# Generate TV Scripts
Project 3 of Udacity's DLND: In this project, we learn how to generate your own 'Seinfeld' TV scripts using RNNs. We use a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons of the show. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.


A snippet of a 1000 word fake script that the network produced:
